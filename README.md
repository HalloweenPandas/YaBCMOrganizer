# YaBCMOrganizer
This tool is here to help out with creating and modifying BCMs. In addition to giving a more organized look into what the various entries do, it can also

* Copy, Delete, and Paste entries
* Copy an entry and its children in full and add them all elsewhere while preserving its hierarchy
* Clipboard can be shared between multiple instances to allow easy copying/pasting between different BCM's
* Automatically reindexes for the OCD
* Easy link to the BCM section of the Skill/Moveset guide for more explanation on the various thing

# Credits
* DemonBoy - Idea and testing
* Eternity - Genser source code helped with the nitty gritty technical bits of the BCM file structure.
* Smithers & LazyBones - For the Skill/Moveset guide and the research into what each BCM entry field does.
